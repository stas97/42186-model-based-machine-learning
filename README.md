Repository for the model based machine learning course at DTU. Course professors are Francisco Pereira and Filipe Rodrigues. This version of the course is from 2019-01.

## Syllabus 
The course aims to teach the students about bayesian inference in probabilistic graphical models. The topics of the course are:
1) Probability and statistic review
2) Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGM) foundations
3) Frequentist vs Bayesian and probabilistic programming languages
4) Regression, classification, time series and topic models. Including a lecture on neural networks use in PGM.
